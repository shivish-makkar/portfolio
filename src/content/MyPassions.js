                        After a whole day of work, I always come back to music to help me relax and prepare for the next
                        day. I engage with music not just by listening it, but learning how to sing as well. I committed
                        to this goal in January 2020 by signing up in a class at my college. I was hoping to learn
                        some basics of singing and overcoming my fear of singing in front of other people.

                        I travel for experiences. My parents took me to many different places while growing up, and as I
                        got older, I found travelling to be the primary reason for my wider perception of the world. I
                        am very proud to say that I have travelled to 23 countries so far. As an 18 year old, I backpacked
                        around seven countries in Europe for a month â€” and I did so absolutely alone! Meeting people from
                        native countries and travellers along the way from countries like Chile all the way to South
                        Korea and learning about the world through them was just an absolutely unparalleled experience.
                        It opened by eyes about the world we live in.
